# ElectionsWakanda

### üìù info:
Blockchain dApp for secure elections in The Kingdom of Wakanda. Six million residents have access to voting. An ERC20 token required for voting (called WKND).
It is safe to assume that **1 WKND** = **1 vote**, and that each Ethereum address (citizen) can vote **only once for only one candidate**.

### :key: registration:
Insert your ETH address and register for voting.

### :writing_hand: voting:

Choose your candidate and insert number of WKND tokens (number of votes) you will spend.

If you want to see top three candidates, you have to click on the **Show Leads**.

Also you can send WKND token to the other citizen (ETH address) because token is transferable.

HELP: You can see your number of WKND tokens in *Console* if you click on the getWKND.
